Some stuff from beyond the yellow brick road?
I'm just checking out what GitHub is all about. 
I don't quite follow what this website/portal actually does. Is this for project management? How do you really use it? What are all these random names all around?
Society suffers from a paucity of actionable information.
Btw I don't see any template file in here.
